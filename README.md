daily routine app that has a set things that must be completed at the end of the day or week.

however you can swap things around/out; but it will count a streak to make sure it is done everyday (🔥); exmaple, workout must be done everyday, but cardio can be swapped out for tennis, tope rope, etc. going out must be done once a week so would be at the bottom of the screen as a weekly progression that resets every week rather than a daily progression. For each section (daily/weekly) you can add more tasks. You can also then edit the daily routine to combine more of the items together like a linked list workout -> cardio -> read as an example. This should be light hearted with pastelle colours like baby red or yellow or baby blue etc
